# Knowledge base
Knowledge base and spaced repetition app inspired by Incremental reading technique from SuperMemo

**Work in progress**

## How it works

1. Read an article (or book) you want to learn
2. Extract useful information into a knowledge base article
   which is like a wiki article
3. Split your article into lots of 
   ["fill the blank"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test)
   cards using special markup, each card containing small piece of information to
   learn
4. Slowly memorize cards over time with a help of a spaced repetition algorithm
5. Organize knowledge in a searchable, interconnected personal database

## Some of the planned features

* HTML as storage format
* Markdown based markup language to simplify card extraction
* Storage of previous revisions of everything, never delete information
* Review cards on mobile device offline
* Store diagrams, formulas and images
